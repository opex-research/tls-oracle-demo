Goal: Extend the code, such that the client can fetch data from a real server.

Server: Twitter

Endpoint: https://api.twitter.com/2/users/:id/followers

--> "A certain user has more than e.g. 50 followers" 

Postman Workspace -- Twitter API v2


PayPal API:

Currently - hard coded access token

TODO: Ask user for credentials & derive access token --> PayPal login request

[X] Write functions to send request
[X] Test functions to send request
[] Automate generation of the access token
[X] Integrate Request and send through proxy - obtain response on the client side
[X] Create policy example for PayPal case 
[X] Fix Polixy parsing with dynamic sequence number
[] Fix hardcoded values in circuit generation - parse from policy, transcript etc

[] addCounter in prove.go is set as a fixed value. This needs to be parsed from the sequence number / record number to be proven
[] aes_gcmm --> The sequence number needs to be XORed with the iv - this is currently hardcoded, need to pass automatically.
[] in prove.go, the threshold needs to be parsed from the policy
